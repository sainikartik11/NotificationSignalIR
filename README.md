# NotificationSignalIR
Build a web app using a web API for back-end and Angular or any JS framework for front-end. Allow long-running async processes, no impact on the UI, and send real-time push notifications on completion. Utilize SignalR and explore alternative techniques.


##About the Project
The goal of this project is to create a web application that leverages a web API for the back-end and Angular or another JavaScript framework for the front-end. The app should be able to manage long-running, asynchronous processes that do not interfere with the app UI. Additionally, real-time push notifications should be sent to the user to provide updates on process completion or failure.

To simulate a lengthy process, a dummy method can be used, which can be created using the Thread.Sleep method. The process should operate in the background without causing any issues with the app UI, enabling users to interact with other parts of the UI. When the process concludes, or if an error occurs, a notification should be dispatched to the UI to keep the user informed
